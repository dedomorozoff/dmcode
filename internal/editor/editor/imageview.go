// A picture is not text, and this file is why the editor can hold one anyway.
//
// The alternative — leaving a PNG to the buffer — puts the bytes in as latin-1
// prose: a column of "ÿØ" boxes, one per pixel row, that scrolls like a file
// and saves back over the picture it came from. So a tab that opens an image
// keeps the decoded frames and an *empty* buffer, and the pane draws the picture
// where the lines would be.
//
// Three decisions are the load-bearing ones:
//
//   - The buffer stays. It is not deleted and not bypassed: about a hundred
//     places index tabs[pane.tabIdx] and call cur(), and an image tab with no
//     buffer is a nil dereference in a key handler rather than a picture. What
//     changes is that nothing may write to it, which is enforced where the keys
//     are handled rather than by making the type optional.
//
//   - Read-only is enforced at the key handler, not by convention. Ctrl+S on a
//     picture tab must refuse rather than write an empty buffer over the file;
//     that is the one path that could destroy what the user opened.
//
//   - The frames are decoded once, at open. Decoding is milliseconds for a
//     screenshot and hundreds for a large photo, and doing it inside View would
//     freeze the interface on every resize and on every frame of an animation.

// imageExtensions are the suffixes worth handing to the decoder.
//
// It is a list rather than a sniff because the question being asked is "should I
// *look* at this", and a decode attempt on every file the editor opens is the
// wrong question to ask of a 4 MB log. The decoder still decides: a .png that
// does not decode opens as text, with the reason in the status line.
